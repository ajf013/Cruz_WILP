## Overview

This project automates the identification, notification, and deletion of orphaned Azure resources — including **Public IPs**, **Network Interfaces (NICs)**, **Managed Disks**, and **Snapshots** — across all subscriptions. It helps reduce unnecessary cloud costs while respecting protection tags and sending personalized email alerts.

Built with PowerShell and Azure Automation, this solution is designed for DevOps teams who value clarity, cost-efficiency, and cultural personalization.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

1. **Import Required Modules** into your Azure Automation Account:
   - `Az.Accounts`
   - `Az.Network`
   - `Az.Compute`
   - `Az.Resources`
   - `Az.CostManagement`

2. **Set Runtime Version** to **PowerShell 7.2** for compatibility.

3. **Create Automation Variables**:
   - `SendGridApiKey` (Encrypted string)

4. **Assign Permissions** to the Automation Account’s Managed Identity:
   - Reader or Contributor on target subscriptions
   - Cost Management Reader
   - Resource deletion permissions

5. **Customize Email Templates** if needed (e.g., add Tamil greetings, emojis, or branding).

## 📬 Email Notifications

Each email includes:
- Resource details (name, group, location, subscription)
- Current or saved cost in ₹ INR
- Reminder or deletion notice
- Protection status if applicable

Emails are sent using SendGrid with HTML formatting for clarity and professionalism.

## 🧠 Logic Flow

```text
For each subscription:
    For each orphaned resource:
        If DO NOT DELETE = yes:
            Send protection email
        Else:
            If OrphanedSince not tagged:
                Tag with today's date
            If days left in [7,5,3,1]:
                Send reminder email
            If days left = 0:
                Delete resource
                Send deletion confirmation with cost saved

Azure Automation team
